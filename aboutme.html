                    <p>Howl Jenkins Pendragon (ハウル・ジェンキンス・ペンドラゴン, Hauru Jenkinsu Pendoragon) is a powerful wizard living in the land of Ingary. Originally Howell Jenkins of Wales, he was part of a loose fraternity of wizards on Earth. He made his way through a magical portal to Ingary, where he became known and respected as one of the most powerful wizards there was. He owns a moving castle, and spreads rumors about himself to retain his privacy, opting to be alone and hiding from all conflict.</p>
                    
                    <p class="dark">Howl is a very talented wizard, and is also quite good at slithering out of things he does not wish to do - a talent he cultivated through his sister's unwitting aid - and can change into different animals (he's seen as a cat, a dog and an unidentified monster). In the movie, he is able to transform in to a large beast with black feathers and seemly various stages of transformation. He uses this power to fly to the battlefield and fight as well as to escape from enemies.</p>

                    <h3>What are the purposes of this website</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this website is showing and meeting my own personal inspiration. First of it is Ghibli Studio, which created a tons of masterpieces besides Howl's Moving Castle. Secondly, I wanted to present to you my amazing character - Howl, who I want to strive to be like.<br>
                      The second purpose is to show off my rookie web-design skills and engaging programmers and developers who tend to get frequently an inspiration from watching anime to move and keep improving in this IT-world together.<br> Let's get in touch and I will do my best to keep our conversation going fascinatingly ✨
